*The C language and its biggest problem; proving its insecurity.*
(Written by FlyWithMe - A Simplex chat user)
# 2026 / 01 / 01 #


	C is not a safe language, although it is possible to create secure software with it. Regardless of the programmer's skill or the amount of code reviews performed, it is impossible, using C, to create software with perfect memory management. Although formally verified software is possible, it is almost non-existent; few examples can be found, such as the seL4 microkernel, the CompCert compiler, and the C compiler.

	The fact is that formal verification is extremely difficult and costly to perform, so it should not be considered a solution, but rather a remote possibility.

	And for those who mistakenly or arrogantly claim, out of ignorance or vanity, that these bugs and vulnerabilities caused by improper memory management are rare and obsolete, I present a factual and statistical analysis of the case.



## Analysis: Memory Management Vulnerabilities in CVE (2015-2025) ##

*Total Data:*

	Based on the CVEDetails.com database and NIST NVD data, all registered CVEs from 2015 to December 20, 2025[1][2][3] were analyzed.

"Total CVEs analysed: 107,173"


*Vulnerabilities of Memory Management:*

Category: Overflow (buffer, stack). Total CVEs: 15,882
Category: Memory Corruption (heap, use-after-free, out-of-bounds). Total CVEs: 20,777 .
Total: 36,659


*Percentage of Memory Management Vulnerabilities*

36,659 ÷ 107,173 × 100 = *34.20%*


	Therefore, 34.20% of all software vulnerabilities registered between 2015 and 2025 are related to memory management errors (buffer overflows, heap overflows, use-after-free, out-of-bounds reads/writes)[1][2].


*Distribution by Year*

The annual analysis reveals significant fluctuations:

| Year | Memory Vulnerabilities | Total CVEs | Percentage |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 2015 | 1,436 			| 3,758	     | 38.22% 	  |
| 2016 | 1,514 			| 3,355	     | 45.13% 	  |
| 2017 | 4,011 			| 10,458     | 38.35% 	  |
| 2018 | 3,808 			| 10,644     | 35.74% 	  |
| 2019 | 3,209 			| 9,081	     | 35.35% 	  |
| 2020 | 3,066 			| 8,248	     | 37.18% 	  |
| 2021 | 4,184 			| 10,414     | 40.18% 	  |
| 2022 | 4,685 			| 12,198     | 38.39% 	  |
| 2023 | 3,741 			| 12,568     | 29.76% 	  |
| 2024 | 4,171 			| 15,377     | 27.12% 	  |
| 2025 | 2,834 			| 11,478     | 24.68% 	  |
|---------------------------------------------------------|

# Important context
	It is important to note that this overall proportion of 34.20% varies significantly depending on the type of software and programming language:


*For compiled code in C/C++: The ratio rises to 66-75%[4][5][6][7]. Studies of large organizations confirm:*

- "Microsoft": 70% of CVEs are related to memory management[4][6]
- "Google": 70% of bugs in Chromium are memory; 90% on Android[8][4][9]
- Apple: 60-70% of vulnerabilities in iOS and macOS[9]
- Linux Kernel: 66% of vulnerabilities[5]
- "Project Zero (Google)": 75% of the CVEs exploited in the wild world were from memory; 67% of zero-days in 2021[10][7]

*"For memory-safe languages" (Java, Python, C#): The proportion is less than 5%.*

# Temporal trend

	The above trend chart shows that while the "absolute number" of memory vulnerabilities remains high, the "relative percentage" has decreased from approximately 38-45% (2015-2016) to 24-29% (2024-2025). This is because other categories of vulnerabilities (particularly XSS, which grew to 31.18% of the total) are increasing faster[1][2].


# *Conclusion*

	Of the "107.173 software vulnerabilities" registered between 2015 and 2025, "36,659 (34.20%) are related to memory management errors". This global percentage hides the most worrying reality: in compiled software that dominates critical infrastructures (C/C++), approximately 2 in 3 vulnerabilities (66-70%) are caused by memory management errors, reinforcing the ongoing appeals of CISA, NSA and other agencies for the adoption of memory-safe languages[5][6][7].
