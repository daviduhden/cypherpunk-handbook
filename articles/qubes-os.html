      <section>
        <p class="lede">The aim of the following article is to provide
        constructive criticism of the Linux distro Qubes OS (or XenOS),
        highlighting its weaknesses, strengths, and then suggesting possible
        improvements. Finally, it proposes better, more robust, and reliable
        alternatives, particularly in terms of security, for different types of
        users.</p>

        <h2>1 - Xen Hypervisor:</h2>

        <p>Virtual machines run on a hypervisor, Xen in the case of QubesOS.
        Xen is a type 1 hypervisor, meaning it operates at the physical
        hardware level (bare metal), i.e., it has direct contact with the
        hardware (Ring 0). This implies that virtualization does not
        automatically guarantee greater security compared to direct execution
        on the hardware: although the hypervisor isolates and manages VM
        resources, it also becomes a single point of trust. A hardened kernel
        can incorporate many specific protection mechanisms; if the hypervisor
        is poorly designed, has bugs, or is compromised, the impact can be
        greater than an equivalent failure in the kernel of a physical machine.
        Hardware/firmware vulnerabilities (e.g., microcode flaws, speculative
        execution bugs) can also affect isolation.</p>

        <p>In reality, with Intel and AMD's virtualization extensions (VT-x and
        AMD-V), the hypervisor does not run in the guest's Ring 0: it runs in
        VMX root mode / host mode (the so-called logical "ring &minus;1"),
        while the virtual machine kernel continues to see itself as Ring 0, but
        in practice runs in VMX non-root mode / guest mode. This gives the
        hypervisor additional control and privileges over the hardware and VMs;
        therefore, if the hypervisor is compromised, the impact and scope of
        the attack can be much greater.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, Xen offers a form of virtualization known as
        paravirtualization. Paravirtualization is a virtualization technique
        that involves modifying the guest operating system, providing a
        software interface to virtual machines that is very similar to, but not
        identical to, the underlying hardware. Paravirtualization eliminates
        the need for full hardware emulation, providing faster task execution
        and better overall performance. However, in paravirtualization, the
        guest operating system knows it is running in a virtual environment;
        this allows direct communication between the guest operating system and
        the hypervisor. The guest OS uses "hypercalls" to communicate with the
        hypervisor. The requirement for direct communication via hypercalls
        creates a strong dependency between the operating system and the
        hypervisor, increasing the attack surface and potential
        vulnerabilities. Any changes or updates can lead to compatibility
        difficulties, potentially breaking virtualization. There are other
        opportunities for misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. This is the
        price to pay when choosing usability over security.</p>

        <p>Currently Xen has support for Hardware-assisted virtualization (Xen
        calls it hardware virtual machine (HVM)), it's a way of improving
        overall efficiency of hardware virtualization using help from the host
        processors (Intel VT-x, AMD-V). Now a full virtualization is used to
        emulate a complete hardware environment, or virtual machine, in which
        an unmodified guest operating system (using the same instruction set as
        the host machine) effectively executes in complete isolation. Xen
        offers five approaches to running the guest operating system but only
        the Microsoft Windows template in Qubes OS support fully
        hardware-assisted virtualization, all other form of virtualization
        involve paravirtualization which is much less secure than...</p>

        <p>There is a much secure form of virtualization than
        paravirtualization, called "Full Virtualization". Full virtualization
        is a virtualization technique that completely simulates the underlying
        hardware in a virtual machine (VM). The VM is fully isolated from the
        host system, simulating the hardware environment to run an unmodified
        guest operating system (OS). Full virtualization establishes a virtual
        environment that emulates the physical hardware of a computer system.
        Unlike other virtualization methods, it does not require modifications
        to the operating system (OS) to create virtual machines (VMs) or manage
        resources. This allows guest operating systems to function as though
        they have exclusive control over critical resources such as the CPU,
        memory, and storage. The result is a virtualization solution that
        provides robust performance and strong isolation for security. But of
        course this has a price, which is the lowest performance and the
        greater use of resources. Examples of Full Virtualization with
        Hardware-assisted virtualization are: KVM (Linux), Hyper-V (Windows),
        VirtualBox (type 2 hypervisor) and VMM (OpenBSD).</p>

        <p>Several attacks on Qubes OS originate in an AppVM, and some
        historical exploits have used Xen vulnerabilities to escape the guest
        and compromise Dom0 or other VMs. However, not all attacks go through
        Xen-there are also vectors via firmware (ME/PSP), drivers, IOMMU, or
        flaws in Dom0 and SystemVMs. The most important link in the system is
        also the most vulnerable, so vulnerable that support for the use of
        OpenBSD for dom0 and domU has been officially proposed and debated,
        with everyone agreeing that it would be very good and extremely
        beneficial for the security of QubesOS, but this does not happen due to
        the incompatibility of OpenBSD with Linux and other software.</p>

        <p><a href=
        "https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4551">https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4551</a>
        </p>

        <p>The use of OpenBSD for NetVM (sys-net) was also proposed, due to its
        extreme vulnerability to attacks. Almost all arguments were in favor,
        but admitted the impossibility due to incompatibility:</p>

        <p><a href=
        "https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/5294">https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/5294</a>
        </p>

        <p>But all this would only remedy the inevitable: the hypervisor will
        always be the weakest link. An OpenBSD running directly on the hardware
        tends to have a smaller attack surface than when running on a VM,
        because virtualization adds layers (hypervisor, firmware, drivers) that
        broaden the risk surface. Many believe that the fact that dom0 does not
        connect to the internet makes it 100% secure, which is not true.</p>

        <p>An exploited NetVM can, for example, serve as a starting point for
        attacks that escape to other VMs or to dom0, compromising the entire
        system. The fact that dom0 does not have internet access is good for
        protecting against remote attacks targeting dom0, which attempt to
        "bypass" the need to escape from a VM to access it; this simply does
        not protect against the escape of one or more compromised VMs. Logical
        isolation loses effectiveness if all VMs and services depend on the
        same underlying platform (in this case, Xen). Even Hyper-V (the Windows
        hypervisor) has had far fewer CVEs and VM leaks than Xen in recent
        years, LOL. The Windows virtualizer security model is arguably more
        mature, especially on supported enterprise hardware, than QubesOS.</p>

        <p>I could write another 10,000 lines about why hypervisors/virtual
        machines are unreliable and insecure, addressing everything from
        hardware architecture to software. However, I will only quote here a
        response from Theo the Raadt (creator of OpenBSD) to some OpenBSD users
        who were in a discussion about the Xen hypervisor and whether OpenBSD
        intended to implement it or something similar:</p>

        <p>Wow! Theo is a really based guy. Who would have thought that the
        creator of one of the world's most secure operating systems would be so
        against virtualization? Does he have the authority and knowledge to
        talk about it? Yes, I think so, much more than the vast majority of
        programmers in the world.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://theos.com/deraadt/">https://theos.com/deraadt/</a>
          </li>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The argument most used by the developers of QubesOS is the argument
        of denial (the first stage of trauma). They say "A hypervisor scape is
        rare", "these attacks are difficult to make", "you have no reason to
        worry about it". But the truth is that most hypervisors only benefit
        from such "security by obscurity", since most malware that infects
        computers do not aim to exploit a virtual machine because the chances
        of being inside a virtual machine are lower than in an host operating
        system, in the same way that most malware is designed to affect Windows
        and not Linux systems.</p>

        <p>The attackers naturally do not target hypervisors, but from the
        moment this begins to become more famous and more users adopt (and is
        getting, QubesOS and virtual machines is growing a lot) will be a path
        of no return to the destruction of most hypervisors, especially Xen.
        And this is mainly due to the fact QubesOS/Xen does not try to hide
        from the guests VMs that they are VMs. From this we go to the topic
        number 2.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2 - Lack of spoofing:</h2>

        <p>When using any operating system in virtual machines, you don't hide
        the fact that you're using a virtual machine from the guest system;
        it's extremely simple and easy to verify, within the guest system, that
        it's a VM. This is demonstrated, for example, in Windows, through
        registry keys, virtual machine processes, driver files, and other
        system files. Inside a Windows VM, you might even receive a system
        notification indicating that you're in a virtual machine.</p>

        <p>But it is totally possible to mask this and there are even scripts
        and tutorials on the internet that aim to hide from inside a VM any
        information about it (On Linux this can be more easy to do because of
        control):</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href=
            "https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=112808">https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=112808</a>
          </li>

            "https://github.com/d4rksystem/VMwareCloak">https://github.com/d4rksystem/VMwareCloak</a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>But QubesOS does not even try to implement any form of spoofing,
        that is, even a poorly programmed malware can identify that it is
        inside a VM and try to exploit loopholes to break. The fact that an
        attacker knows that the target is using a VM can also drawn more
        attention than normal, just like using VPN + Tor.</p>

        <p>Taking into account that qubes templates are modified images of
        operating systems, it should not be absurd to implement spoofing.
        QubesOS can improve on this if the devs want.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3 - It's Linux:</h2>

        <p>Qubes OS uses a dom0 based on a version of Fedora and standard Linux
        kernels; therefore, it is not inherently more secure than running that
        same outdated Fedora directly on the hardware. You need to compile the
        kernel with your own parameters if you want to have a minimum of
        security, but this will certainly break the entire system, because
        QubesOS is already unstable and incompatible by default (I want to see
        QubesOS users/developers deny this fact).</p>

        <p>The QubesOS dom0 is maintained on a base, outdated and relatively
        unprotected/unstable version of Fedora. The base Linux does not have
        decent security mitigations, protections against memory
        vulnerabilities, and many other problems that come with the Linux
        kernel and ecosystem. The standard Linux kernel is relatively insecure
        and unprotected compared to other Linux kernel alternatives or other
        operating systems kernels.</p>

        <p>A hacked 'sys-net' can spy on the memory of the rest of your qubes.
        QubesOS devs are always in denial saying things like: "Well those
        buffer overflows and mem attacks are rare", but this is false, in fact,
        66-70% of vulnerabilities in software written in C are related to poor
        memory management.</p>

        <p>See my other article proving this: <a href="./c-language.html">The C
        language and its biggest problem; proving its insecurity</a></p>

        <p>And these cowardly statements from the QubeOS developers makes all
        this compartmentalization useless because that's what hackers do, they
        focus on the weakest link. It is "rare" until the operating system
        starts to be used by many people and attracts the spotlight of the NSA
        or the FBI, just like Tails (taking into account that Edward Snowden
        spoke about this operating system, I'm 100% sure that it already has).
        The safety of QubesOS is more based on safety by obscurity than
        anything else.</p>

        <p>QubesOS can improve this with security kernel patches, such as
        Grsecurity/PaX and/or linux-hardened kernel support, LKRG, compilation
        with hardening flags, FORTIFY, PIE, RELRO. And Mandatory Access Control
        (MAC), such as TOMOYO and SELinux (Fedora templates support SELinux on
        QubesOS, but outdated, without a good setup (policies) by default, and
        no support for enforcing without breaking the entire system).</p>

        <p><a href="https://secureblue.dev/">Fedora Secureblue</a>&nbsp;is an
        example of the bare minimum that must be done to be considered "a
        reasonably secure operating system", implement kernel patches, changes
        several system files and have a powerful MAC added with limited
        namespaces. Something that QubesOS doesn't do.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4 - Complexity:</h2>

        <p>Qubes OS is a complex operating system even for advanced users,
        which increases the likelihood of human error that could compromise
        security or anonymity. This contrasts with systems like Secureblue,
        GrapheneOS, or OpenBSD, which protect users against human error by
        default and out of the box. In fact, complexity always brings security
        problems.</p>

        <p>QubesOS is NOT secure by default, and NEVER will be.</p>

        <p>I believe I don't need to elaborate on this topic. The increase in
        complexity will always be proportional to the increase in
        insecurity.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5 - SystemD:</h2>

        <p>SystemD. Use the "systemd-analyze security" command in your terminal
        and see what you get with this demonic piece of junk. My challenge to
        everyone reading this is to try to get the score of each service to at
        least "OK" without completely breaking the system. I've never seen any
        idiot SystemD defender open their mouth to defend it after discovering
        the existence of this command. But the first phase of trauma will
        always be denial.</p>

        <p>SystemD is extremely complex and full of modules; it's software that
        tries to do many things at once. A compromised SystemD is a compromised
        operating system, and SystemD is a gigantic attack surface. SystemD is
        currently divided into 5 layers:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>5. systemd Utilities</li>

          <li>3. and 4. systemd Deamons and systemd Targets</li>

          <li>1. systemd Core</li>

          <li>0. systemd Libraries (the base)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each layer has several programs and modules, which are more and more
        attack surfaces. It's almost like a complete operating system; in fact,
        a kernel plus systemd is already a complete operating system.</p>

        <h2>6 - Bad hardware support and compatibility:</h2>

        <p>On the QubesOS Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) page it shows that
        not even 5% of the existing hardware is 100% compatible with the
        QubesOS + Linux kernel in its latest versions and HVM (only for
        windows), IOMMU (required for effective isolation) and SLAT without
        showing insane problems, this will certainly lead to many basic and
        even patched security vulnerabilities.</p>

        <p><a href=
        "https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/">https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl</a>
        </p>

        <p>Having 100% hardware compatibility with this OS is like playing the
        lottery, not even the devs know for sure which hardware is experimental
        and which is not, except for the so-called "certified hardware", which
        are just 11 devices that no one uses and 3 of them no longer receive
        microcode updates on the CPU.</p>

        <p>If you look closely at the "Remark" field (HCL page), you'll see
        ridiculous bugs and/or workarounds to make the system work, such as: +

        <p>I could go on, but this doesn't even represent 30% of all the
        problems reported by users on various hardware. Many require
        downgrading the kernel, drivers, or operating system version to
        function "correctly".</p>

        <p>This is a widespread problem, and QubesOS is decades away from
        having reasonable (stable and reliable) hardware compatibility; this
        would require a great deal of effort or even a replacement of
        developers if the issue at hand is competence. This is not a problem
        inherent to Linux systems, but rather to Qubes OS.</p>

        <p>So if you don't have any of these following 11 devices know that you
        won't have full support and compatibility with "all of Qubes' features"
        (i.e. Basic security features)</p>

        <p><a href=
        "https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/hardware/certified-hardware/certified-hardware.html#qubes-certified-computers">
        https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/hardware/certified-hardware/certified-hardware.html#qubes-certified-computers</a>
        </p>

        <p>And pay attention to what the devs themselves say on their official
        website:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>There is a class of security vulnerabilities that can be fixed
          only by microcode updates. If your computer or the CPU in it no
          longer receives microcode updates (e.g., because it is too old), it
          may not be possible for some of these vulnerabilities to be mitigated
          on your system, leaving you vulnerable.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And this is because QubesOS strongly needs the &lsquo;Virtualization
        Technology' of CPUs to function, such as Intel VT-x, Intel VT-d, AMD-V
        and AMD-Vi. The basis of this OS is the proprietary microcode to
        support virtualization of CPUs from vendors, any vulnerability in this
        hardware/microcode fully affects QubesOS. This is so pathetic it's sad,
        the OS needs proprietary CPU code to function and be secure.</p>

        <p>The security of QubesOS does not come from the OS, but from the
        competence of Intel and AMD programmers, this only increases the attack
        surface of the operating system and Xen, instead of reducing it as they
        mistakenly claim. And that cannot be changed.</p>

        <p>One major and serious problem that no one seems to realize is that
        QubesOS, being "an operating system for only 11 selected hardware
        devices," makes it extremely vulnerable to coordinated and focused
        attacks, such as hardware backdoors. Look, if you know that a specific
        group of people (the ones you want to target) use specific devices from
        specific vendors, it becomes much easier to poison the food chain. And
        this isn't something I made up. The FBI (and intelligence agencies like
        NSA and Mossad) have done this many times, one instance being when they
        sold a cell phone through a front company promising it was "an
        extremely secure and private phone," which many criminals bought, used,
        and were subsequently arrested (more than 800 criminals were
        arrested).</p>

        <p><a href=
        "https://www.pcmag.com/news/fbi-sold-criminals-fake-encrypted-phones-that-actually-copied-their-messages?test_uuid=04IpBmWGZleS0I0J3epvMrC&amp;test_variant=A">

        </p>

        <p>So, besides QubesOS having such significant hardware limitations, it
        makes backdoor implementation even easier because it's an operating
        system that relies on Intel and AMD's microcode/virtualization
        technology. Compromising that would compromise all users of this
        operating system. I'm not saying QubesOS is the only OS vulnerable to
        hardware backdoors; in fact, all OSs are, but QubesOS is the MOST
        vulnerable to this type of thing. A Linux or BSD user who doesn't use
        virtual machines doesn't need to worry about backdoors in the specific
        CPU's virtualization technology microcode, nor on 11 specific
        devices.</p>

        <p>And it gets even worse when dom0 can only use Fedora, meaning, "holy
        shit, it got 1000 times worse!", compromising the Fedora repositories
        makes any update to dom0 a total system breaking point. There is no
        salvation for QubesOS.</p>

        <h2>7 - TPM 1.2/TPM 2.0 requirement/support:</h2>

        <p>QubesOS needs support for TPM 1.2 to implement the basics of AEM
        (Anti Evil Maid), because without it the system is ridiculously
        vulnerable to physical attacks, it is even funny that a system that
        says it is so safe for its defenders becomes weak as a sheet of paper
        when physically invaded.</p>

        <p><a href=
        "https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/security-in-qubes/anti-evil-maid.html">
        https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/security-in-qubes/anti-evil-maid.html</a>
        </p>

        <p>But TPM2 adds more code, firmware, and initrd complexity (tpm2‑tss,
        dracut/hooks, crypttab, signed UKIs). That raises the boot‑time TCB and
        operational fragility, misconfiguration can break boot or weaken
        security. TPM2 relies on vendor (close source) firmware and tpm2-tss
        implementations, firmware or vendor backdoors/bugs in TPM microcode are
        a single point of persistent compromise. If TPM firmware (or Intel
        PTT/ME interactions) is compromised, TPM attestation/sealing can be
        subverted and used to hide persistent tampering from the user.</p>

        <p>This shit is more a backdoor than anything else. TPM
        manufactures/suppliers have a unique identification key (EK) that, if
        linked to a actual identity or shared with thrid parties could allow
        device identification or linking. And these keys can be easily
        discovered through the operating system (especially windows), a malware
        programmed for this can totally deanonymize a QubesOS user through the
        TPM unique ID, which are hardware identifiers. That is, if you did not
        buy your device in an 100% anonymous way, it's over! Not to mention all
        other remote vulnerabilities involving TPM.</p>

        <p>This could easily be mitigated if QubesOS did not support TPM or the
        most TPM-based features (like OpenBSD, which TPM "Functionality is
        limited to instructing the device to save its state before a system
        suspend."), so it would be impossible to access such keys without being
        physically. And TPM 2.0 is even worse than 1.2, much more code and
        complexity (In other words, much more attack surface.).</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Qubes security guidelines dictate that USB devices should never be
          attached directly to dom0, since this can result in the entire system
          being compromised. However, in its default configuration, installing
          and using AEM requires attaching a USB drive directly to dom0.</p>

        itself.</p>

        <blockquote>

          this carries significant security implications, as explained

        </blockquote>

        <p>In other words, to have minimum security you need to do something
        unsafe that could compromise the system? Good.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>This presents us with a classic security trade-off: each Qubes
          user must make a choice between protecting dom0 from a potentially
          malicious USB drive, on the one hand, and protecting the system from
          Evil Maid attacks, on the other hand.</p>

          e.g.&nbsp;me_cleaner while installing coreboot (or libreboot) then
          you are out of luck. For now you have to choose between cleaning your
          BIOS and deploying Anti Evil Maid.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This is so fucked, QubesOS needs Intel ME (a literal backdoor) to
        have minimal protection against Anti Evil Maid.</p>

        <p>Intel Management Engine (ME) runs at a more privileged level than
        the OS kernel, it can be considered "Ring -3" (Below the CPU or kernel
        ring 0). Intel ME runs its own proprietary microkernel and firmware on
        its hardware independent of the BIOS/UEFI and operating system, runs
        independently of the main CPU. It is turned on and running even after
        turning off the device and is able to connect to the internet
        independently and without any action from the device user because:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Intel ME is powered by a minimum power source while the
            motherboard is connected to the power (S0ix/Standby/even whit OS
            shut down). So any power source like a notebook battery or residual
            energy feeds the IME 24 hours a day.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>IME has access to the network controller (NIC) or can use an
            integrated network controller managed by ME, allowing for network
            communication independently.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Implements a network channel and TCP/IP stack itself or proxy
            through NIC to receive remote management commands (e.g.&nbsp;wake,
            KVM, provisioning).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>In modes such as "Out-of-Band" (OOB) the ME responds to special
            packages sent by the management infrastructure, enabling diagnosis
            and remote access. This is used by Intel support if your device has
            any problems, so they can remotely access for analysis and control.
            This can be done by official website online support&hellip;
            Crazy.</p>

            <p>AMD has something similar called PSP, but it doesn't seem to be
            able to connect to the internet? Libreboot/Coreboot removes this as
            well. Furthermore, Libreboot is far superior to UEFI SecureBoot.

            "https://libreboot.org/docs/linux/grub_hardening.html">https://libreboot.org/docs/linux/grub_hardening.html</a></p>

            <p>Vulnerabilities or backdoors in these subsystems (Intel ME or
            AMD PSP) can allow access to VM data or compromise isolation, as
            they operate at a lower layer than the hypervisor.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>More on this topic from an authority in the field: <a href=
        "https://youtu.be/B4cOQOXjxew">https://youtu.be/B4cOQOXjxew</a></p>

        <p>The truth is that a physical attack on the device is game over; no
        TPM, or even less so Intel ME, can protect you against that, against
        hardware compromise. The goal should be to protect the operating system
        and the data stored on the disk, and this can be done through software,
        with FDE (Full Disk Encryption) which supports encryption even of the
        boot partition; verification of the file system (like NetBSD Veriexec)
        and/or immutability and the kernel. Because if that device is
        maliciously compromised physically, at least you can take your HDD/SSD
        and put it in another computer safely.</p>

        <p>There is no guarantee that the TPM, Intel ME, and proprietary
        firmware code will not already be compromised before you even buy the
        computer; there is no guarantee of their reliability even through code
        review, let alone their functionality. On the contrary, the guarantee
        is that this will increase the attack surface and add more
        vulnerabilities to your operating system.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Does Qubes use full disk encryption (FDE)?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p>By default, Qubes OS uses LUKS/dm-crypt to encrypt everything
          except the /boot partition.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And that's why QubesOS is so vulnerable to physical attacks and
        needs two backdoors to "be secure." Meanwhile, there are several Linux
        systems that support encryption of the /boot partition, or could
        support it with the correct file system. Other operating systems also
        have this, such as GrepheneOS, OpenBSD, and NetBSD (NetBSD not by
        default).</p>

        <h2>9 - Horrible for servers:</h2>

        <p>QubesOS is a real useless piece of junk when it comes to servers.
        But what does that really say about the system? Well, being extremely
        secure but useless for servers is a huge contradiction, since a server
        is what needs security the most in the world of technology.</p>

        <p>Ever wondered why server-oriented operating systems are so much more
        secure compared to others that aren't? Windows Server is incomparably
        more secure than regular Windows, Red Hat Linux is much more secure
        than Fedora, the same for Ubuntu Server; FreeBSD is incredibly secure,
        OpenBSD is the most secure BSD and one of the most secure operating
        systems of all time. And they all have something in common: they were
        made for servers. One of the biggest pieces of evidence that an
        operating system isn't secure is the fact that it's bad or useless for
        servers. (RHEL, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD can also be used for
        desktops).</p>

        <p>Being good for servers is not just something optional for a system
        that aims for security, it is about having availability, integrity,
        scalability, stability and reliability. Good server operating systems
        naturally need to have many qualities that favor security, a system
        like QubesOS that is not even stable in terms of hardware cannot and
        should not consider itself worthy of entering a security debate.</p>

        <p>After all, the qubes were made to be disposable and not permanent,
        besides QubesOS is not a stable system (I'm going to say this until the
        word "stability" enters the developers' anus.), all this opposes what a
        server needs. QubesOS is worthless for safe, available, reliable and
        stable storage in the long term. The main security tool of QubesOS is
        the fact that the qubes are disposable is a great way to admit that the
        system is not safe from attacks directly on it. It is literally the
        devs admitting: "Qubes OS is safe because if you install malware, you
        can try to shut down the virtual machine before the malware compromises
        the system.". It's like running in the rain to avoid getting wet or at
        least less wet.</p>

        <p>QubesOS can improve on this by ceasing to exist.</p>

        <h2>10 - Networking exposure: trust in NetVMs and the split‑driver
        model</h2>

        <p>Qubes centralizes network access in one or more network‑facing qubes
        (NetVMs) and uses a split‑driver model that places privileged driver
        frontends in unprivileged domains, concentrating attack risk on those
        domains.</p>

        <p>NetVMs are the primary external attack surface. Any remotely
        exploitable flaw in a network-facing qube (browser rendering engine,
        SSH, Tor client, VPN daemon, kernel network stack) or in the
        paravirtualized network device frontends can be used to pivot toward
        the hypervisor or other qubes. Split drivers reduce driver code in
        dom0, but expose complex device‑frontends and device‑backend channels
        (hypercalls, shared memory, event channels) that have been the vector
        in many hypervisor‑escape designs. Network‑facing qubes routinely need
        wide protocol stacks and third‑party code (wireless firmware, userland
        VPNs, DNS, TLS libraries), all large, frequently changed attack
        surfaces.</p>

        <p>Remote exploitation of NetVMs can yield persistent compromise of
        network qubes and enable staged attempts at privileged escapes, data
        exfiltration, or manipulations of other qubes' network traffic. For
        attackers, NetVM is the main target and the most exposed and vulnerable
        part of the system.</p>

        <p>QubesOS can improve this by running alternative NetVMs
        (OpenBSD/Hardened Linux/pfSense/OPNsense). The user can improve this by
        moving parts of the network stack to an external appliance (physical
        router/firewall or separate hardware VM) to reduce local exposure, but
        at this point it's better to just stop using this OS and look for
        something better.</p>

        <h2>11 - Forensics, logging, and incident response limitations</h2>

        <p>Qubes' compartmentalization and disposable‑qube model complicate
        centralized, tamper‑evident logging and post‑incident forensic
        analysis, reducing assurance after a suspected compromise.</p>

        <p>Effective incident response relies on reliable logs,
        chain‑of‑custody for evidence, and the ability to reconstruct an
        attacker's actions. Qubes encourages ephemeral qubes and per‑VM
        storage; by default logs are scattered across multiple filesystems in
        different security domains and may be discarded with disposable qubes.
        Isolated qubes with differing trust levels can intentionally block or
        tamper with logging for plausible deniability (something that QubesOS
        is terrible at proving compared to other alternatives like Tails).</p>

        <p>This makes it impossible for the user to even discover if their
        system has been compromised, increasing the damage caused instead of
        reducing it, and giving the attacker more comfort, making them feel
        invisible, and they will be.</p>

        <p>After a breach, investigators may find incomplete telemetry, missing
        cross‑qube event correlation, and lack of secure, centralized audit
        trails. That reduces the ability to determine scope, persistence, and
        exfiltration, and it complicates proving whether a host‑level
        compromise occurred (hypervisor/dom0) versus a guest compromise. For
        high‑assurance environments this weakens incident handling and forensic
        confidence. This makes it likely impossible to verify and prove whether
        your operating system or any of your VMs are compromised, allowing
        malware to remain active indefinitely without the user's knowledge,
        increasing the damage caused instead of reducing it, and giving the
        attacker more comfort, making them feel invisible, and they will be...
        Do I need to explain why this is terrible?</p>

        <p>Mitigations and limits: Best practice is to forward immutable,
        signed logs off‑host to a remote collector under operator control
        (write‑once storage or secure SIEM); use cryptographic attestation
        where possible; and maintain dedicated, high‑trust audit qubes with
        strict ingestion policies. These measures add operational complexity
        and still require careful threat modeling to avoid introducing new
        attack channels. At this point, you can just look for something
        better.</p>

        <h2>12 - Bad for high threat model. Lack of enterprise‑grade vendor
        support, certified SLAs, and predictable patching.</h2>

        <p>Qubes OS is poorly suited for enterprise and regulated environments
        because it lacks the operational infrastructure that enterprise
        security depends on. It's terrible for companies looking for a safe
        system for their threat model. This is not a bug, it is a design
        choice. However, the consequences are real.</p>

        <p>If Qubes discovers a critical hypervisor vulnerability on a Friday
        afternoon, there is no SLA requiring a patch within 24 hours.</p>

        <p>Qubes lacks broad commercial vendor support, certified long‑term
        platforms, and enterprise SLAs (Service Level Agreement) that
        organizations rely on for managed incident response and guaranteed
        security updates.</p>

        <p>Enterprises and high‑assurance deployments expect vendor
        accountability: predictable patch timelines, coordinated disclosure,
        tested updates for large fleets, and contractual incident response.
        Commercial server OS vendors (RHEL, Ubuntu LTS, AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux,
        Windows Server) or OSes with commercial support ecosystems (FreeBSD,
        OpenBSD, NetBSD) provide certified hardware stacks, long support
        windows, livepatching, and support contracts - all essential for
        production security operations. Qubes' community‑driven model offers
        technical guidance and timely advisories for affected components, but
        it does not replace formal vendor SLAs or large‑scale patch‑validation
        workflows.</p>

        <p>Organizations adopting Qubes face higher operational risk: ad‑hoc
        update procedures, limited certified hardware choices, no commercial
        guarantee of coordinated response at scale, and potential
        incompatibilities with enterprise management/orchestration tooling.
        This increases the cost, complexity and uncertainty of deploying Qubes
        in corporate, critical‑infrastructure, or regulated environments. Also,
        in addition, Qubes remains limited to ~10 laptop models without vendor
        validation.</p>

        <p>RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) for example can push patches to
        +10,000 workstations via satellite:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href=
            "https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_satellite/6.2/html/installation_guide">
            https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_satellite/6.2/html/installation_guide</a>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Qubes requires manual updates or ad-hoc scripting. For a regulated
        environment (healthcare, finance), this violates compliance
        expectations for "vendor-managed" security.</p>

        <p>Qubes rejects enterprise reality for experimental (and poor)
        isolation. BSD operating systems, or even other Linux operating
        systems, offer compartmentalization, stability, and security
        (containers, user-space sandboxing, predictable and fast security/bug
        patches, kernel-level isolation, and mitigations) with vendor
        accountability, something Qubes cannot match. For enterprises,
        regulated sectors, or high-risk operations requiring SLAs, BSDs or
        enterprise Linux OSes are the proven and scalable choice.</p>

        <h2>13 - Security through virtualization, but is that all?</h2>

        <p>I'm going to build a straw house but with titanium doors, after all,
        whoever enters only enters through the doors, right? Doors are made for
        this, we all know. Although what I said doesn't make any sense, I'm
        sorry, because I said the word "build", but I'm wrong. Because nothing
        the QubesOS devs did, they created; not Xen, not Fedora or Whonix. What
        they did was gather a pile of mud, stone and pieces of rubbish until
        they formed something that looked like a house. But the doors... Oh the
        doors... They're definitely made of titanium... Right?</p>

        <p>QubesOS is a system that places all its security on top of its
        virtual machines, on top of a hypervisor that its own devs didn't even
        create, Xen is maintained by other, completely different developers.
        But what about the rest of the system? Fuck it, right? Why have a
        consistent, stable and functional system if I can stick 20 virtual
        machines up my ass? Fuck everything else, right?</p>

        <p>Why use operating systems in virtual machines on a bad hypervisor
        (Xen) on a weak, unstable and inconsistent system by default when I can
        use the same operating systems (and much more as QubesOS templates are
        limited) on a better hypervisor (KVM) on much more secure, stable and
        concise systems?</p>

        <p>You can use Whonix (Or BSDs, Windows, MacOS and much more) on any
        Linux through KVM/QEMU, which is literally the official Whonix support,
        why does using Whonix on a weak and unofficially supported hypervisor
        make you think you would be safer or more anonymous? Use Fedora
        Secureblue, Alpine, Gento Hardened and other operating systems that are
        much more secure than QubesOS for this, it's a much smarter thing to
        do. In addition to being able to use any operating system without
        problems through full virtualization; QubesOS templates are modified
        images of OSes made to try to be compatible with Xen. There is no logic
        in saying that this would be safer than using the same operating system
        without modification and natively.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The main way Qubes OS provides privacy is via its integration with
          Whonix. Qubes OS does not claim to provide special privacy (as
          opposed to security) properties in non-Whonix qubes. This includes
          disposables.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><a href=
        "https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/introduction/faq.html#what-about-privacy-in-non-whonix-qubes">
        https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/introduction/faq.html#what-about-privacy-in-non-whonix-qubes</a>
        </p>

        <p>Yet another statement proving that everything QubesOS "possesses"
        doesn't belong to them; nothing inherent in this operating system is
        their own, and they aren't even ashamed to admit it. That's because
        Whonix is ​​the only VM system that protects against VM fingerprinting
        and advanced deanonymization attacks.</p>

        <p>This only increases the complexity of maintaining and organizing the
        operating system, since Xen, Whonix, Fedora and other softwares used in
        Qubes OS are maintained by different developers with different
        purposes. If any bugs or security vulnerabilities are discovered in
        Xen, for example, the Qubes OS developers will be incapable to fix
        them.</p>

        <p>So, once again, why use Qubes OS for this when you can utilize far
        more OSes in virtual machines on more secure and stable systems?</p>

        <h2>14 - Security by Correctness, isolation and randomization

        Rutkowska</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The other two popular approaches are Security by Correctness and
          Security by Obscurity. We don't believe either of these approaches
          are capable of providing reasonable security today, nor do we believe
          that they will be capable of doing so in the foreseeable future.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>With this statement, the developers of Qubes OS admit that their OS
        is weak, buggy, and insecure by default, and that all its security is
        based on:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Is Qubes just another Linux distribution? If you really want to
          call it a distribution, then it's more of a Xen distribution than a
          Linux one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Oh yes, XenOS. That sounds much better LOL.</p>

        <p>To save time, I will directly refute Joanna Rutkowska, the "creator"
        of QubesOS. <a href=
        "https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2008/09/02/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html">
        https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2008/09/02/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html</a></p>

        <h3>Security by Correctness</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The assumption here is obvious: if we can produce software that
          doesn't have bugs (nor any maliciously behaving code), then we don't
          have security problems at all.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Correct, just like any and all software that wants to be secure, it
        needs code auditing. This goes for Xen.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The only problem is that we don't have any tools to make sure that
          a given code is correct (in terms of implementation, design and
          ethical behavior).</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And how do you ensure that the design, implementation and ethical
        behavior of Qubes OS is correct? This also goes for your operating
        system, as you had to plan these steps. If these 3 topics you raised
        are not correct (and they are not, as I have proven in the other
        topics), Qubes OS security does not exist.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>But if we look at various efforts in computer science, we will
          notice a lot of effort has been made to achieve Security by
          Correctness: safe languages, code verifiers (although not sound ones,
          just heuristic based), developer's education, manual code audit,
          etc.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And the same go for the Xen hypervisor and templates. To be reliable
        (which they are not) they need secure code and developer training.
        Where did you get that virtualization security eliminates the
        requirement for secure code? All software needs secure code to be
        secure. Qubes OS uses the Linux kernel and is vulnerable to the same
        insecurities.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Microsoft's famous Secure Development Life-cycle is all about
          Security by Correctness.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>False. The life cycle of Windows is due to the greed for money, as
        it is an operating system with a paid license. In addition to the new
        features and software that no one asks for with each new version of
        Windows, which only makes the OS more insecure and with more attack
        surface. You don't need to have such a short life cycle and no
        additional support this way, and there are several other better
        examples you could use.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The only problem is: all those approaches sometimes work and
          sometimes do not, sometimes they miss some bug</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This applies to any and all software development. There is no way to
        end this, if you think that isolation BY SOFTWARE, (and even by
        hypervisor, which is worse) is a solution, then you are being stupid
        and contradictory.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>and also there are problems that I simple don't believe can be
          addressed by automatic code verifiers or even safe languages, like
          e.g. logic/design bugs or deciding on wheatear a given code behaves
          maliciously or not (after all this is an ethical problem in many
          cases, not a computer science problem).</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>She talks as if her project had not gone through logic and design
        before implementation, I know that in Qubes OS it was done in a stupid
        way, but she treats this project of hers as something that transcends
        reality and physical form, being above men and mortal understanding. In
        the end, your idea is just another project, another drawing, another
        logic thought up by people no more qualified than others.</p>

        <p>Is there anything to protect me against malicious code, logic/design
        bugs or wrong implementation of Xen? How about creating another
        hypervisor to run the Xen hypervisor so I can have security? That's it!
        Let's isolate the hypervisor with more virtual machines, all stuck up
        the ass.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, it is only possible to know whether the code behaves
        maliciously or not through extensive auditing, not only of the lines of
        code but also of the compilation process and binaries. It is possible
        for open source software to have invisible backdoors hidden in
        post-compile binaries, and it is not possible to protect against this
        except through extensive and in-depth auditing. Ultimately, trust
        should be greater in the programmer than in the software. And you,
        Joanna, don't seem trustworthy.</p>

        <p>See about this in Ken Thompson's famous document, Trusting Trust:
        <a href=
        "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf">
        https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf</a></p>

        <h3>Security by isolation</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Simple as it sound, in practice the isolation approach turned out
          to be very tricky to implement.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>No more than virtualization, I promise.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>One problem is how to partition the system into meaningful pieces
          and how to set permissions for each piece. The other problem is
          implementation - e.g. if we take a contemporary consumer OS, like
          Vista, Linux or Mac OSX, all of them have monolithic kernels, meaning
          that a simple bug in any of the kernel components (think: hundreds of
          3rd party drivers running there), allows to bypass of the isolation
          mechanisms provided by the kernel to the rest of the system (process
          separation, ACLs, etc).</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This statement is not absolutely correct. There are kernel-level and
        user-space mechanisms that limit the impact of bugs. Properly
        partitioning and defining policies is difficult. Monoliths expand the
        attack surface, but modern techniques (LSMs, seccomp, KPTI, hardware
        mitigators, and driver isolation) reduce the likelihood of systemic
        compromise.</p>

        <p>Nowadays, and depending on the operating system, affecting the
        entire kernel is extremely more difficult; rarely observed in practice
        compared to past times. Many of the CVEs found in the Linux kernel
        mainline are not even applicable in real distributions (Ubuntu,
        OpenSUSE, Fedora) and depend on a range of factors that are not
        available in operating systems. Not every CVE can be effectively
        exploited in practice due to operating system mitigations. Finding a
        bug is one thing; exploiting it is another. That's what mitigations are
        for, that's what security through randomization is for-to prevent bugs
        from being exploited.</p>

        <p>Microkernels, exokernels and hybrid kernels may be more secure than
        a monolithic kernel by design, but it does not necessarily mean that
        they will be in practice, and it also does not mean that the monolithic
        kernel will necessarily be insecure.</p>

        <p>Kernel exploits in real-world attacks function as post-compromise
        privilege escalation tools, not as self-sufficient vectors for total
        compromise.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Obviously the problem is because the kernels are monolithic. Why
          not implement Security by Isolation on a kernel level then? Well, I
          would personally love that approach, but the industry simply took
          another course and decided that monolithic kernels are better then
          micro-kernels, because it's easier to write the code for them and
          (arguably) they offer better performance.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Please someone introduce this woman to the technological know-how of
        kernel-level isolation! Namespaces, Capabilities, RCTL, Jails, Zones,
        Capsicum, Seatbelt, SELinux, AppArmor, vnet, devfs, VFS, Chroot, Smack,
        Seccomp, LSM hooks, Landlock, SMEP, SMAP, retpoline, NX, DEP, Kernel
        Page-Table Isolation (KPTI), eBPF/XDP&hellip; This woman is crazy if
        she thinks a virtual machine is the only form of isolation.</p>

        <p>And if the problem is the monolithic kernel, why the hell didn't you
        make Qubes OS based on a micro-kernel but on the Linux kernel? Because
        you don't have the ability to program a kernel or because you think the
        only way to isolate is through virtual machines? Or both?</p>

        <p>I acknowledge that a microkernel or even a hybrid kernel can be much
        more secure than a monolithic kernel, however, there is a contradiction
        in your statements. Qubes uses Xen with a privileged dom0 that runs an
        outdated and insecure Linux distribution, which controls devices,
        drivers, and manages other domains (domUs) that are also insecure Linux
        distributions or even Windows.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Many believe, including myself, that this landscape can be changed
          by the virtualization technology.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Holy fuck. Here we go again.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Thin bare-metal hypervisor, like e.g. Xen, can act like a micro
          kernel and enforce isolation between other components in the system -
          e.g. we can move drivers into a separate domain and isolate them from
          the rest of the system.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>You don't need a hypervisor for this, and after all, what isolates
        the hypervisor? Unlike a kernel, a hypervisor cannot have multiple
        security protocols that a kernel or micro-kernel can. A hypervisor
        compromise will cause the same damage as a full kernel compromise, but
        compromising some part of the operating system on bare metal does not
        necessarily lead to a full kernel compromise.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Also, how to make sure that the hypervisor itself is not
          buggy?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>FINALLY SHE THOUGHT OF IT, NOT EVEN THE DEVS OF QUBES OS THOUGHT OF
        IT.</p>

        <h3>Security by Obscurity (or Security by Randomization)</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Finally we have the Security by Obscurity approach that is based
          on the assumption that we cannot get rid of all the bugs (like in
          Security by Isolation approach), but at least we can make
          exploitation of those bugs very hard. So, it's all about making our
          system unfriendly to the attacker.</p>

        <p>If the attacker doesn't know how to attack, there's nothing he can
        do. Different from the hypervisor approach.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The obvious disadvantage of this approach is that it doesn't
          prevent the bugs from being exploited - it only make the meaningful
          exploitation very hard or even impossible.</p>

        <p>"This is a disadvantage as it can make exploiting bugs very
        difficult or IMPOSSIBLE", holy shit what a genius thought.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>But if one is concerned also about e.g. DoS attacks, then Security
          by Obscurity will not prevent them in most cases.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Servers are the ones who have to worry about this, you can't open
        your mouth to talk about it when your operating system is absolutely
        useless in this area. Also, how can a fucking DoS attack affect the
        desktop user? How can this maliciously compromise the operating system
        or hardware? That's a spurious correlation that you just threw up.</p>

        <p>If a DoS attack is carried out against your ISP, home network, or
        online services you use, nothing can be done, and it is up to the
        providers of those services to take action.</p>

        <p>Protection against DoS is done with hardware isolation, router
        filters, load balancers, scrubbing farms at the network edge,
        CDN/Anycast, BGP ACLs, rate-limiting etc. This is the basics of server
        infrastructure but obviously she doesn't know. After all, the trash she
        created is no good for this type of adult subject.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The other problem with obfuscating the code is the performance
          (compiler cannot optimize the code for speed) and maintenance (if we
          got a crash dump on an obfuscated Windows box, we couldn't count on
          help from the technical support).</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>If you want to have security you will have to give up usability. The
        more security, the less usability. The fewer lines of code, the fewer
        features and the less attack surface. Furthermore, this last statement
        is completely false, OpenBSD is the greatest proof that technical
        support is completely possible in a system with randomization; After
        all, there is no operating system with more randomization at the kernel
        level than OpenBSD, which randomizes the order of all kernel libraries
        and the kernel layout (KARL - Kernel Address Randomized Link), all
        without hindering crash dump analysis.</p>

        <p>And you're talking about performance when you previously criticized
        the monolithic kernel and suggested a microkernel, which has far more
        performance overheads and management complexity. Once again, you're
        being contradictory.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Finally there is a problem of proving that the whole scheme is
          correct and that our obfuscator (or e.g. ASLR engine) doesn't
          introduce bugs to the generated code and that we will not get random
          crashes later (that we would be most likely unable to debug, as the
          code will be obfuscated).</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This is not how things work, it is possible to debug and audit the
        randomization process, making the generated code safe and clean. It's
        amazing how she doesn't know this, it's basic software engineering.
        Again, stating that randomization necessarily prevents debugging
        false.</p>

          <p>Many people ask how does Qubes OS differ from other approaches to
          desktop security. Today I'm trying to answer the most popular
          questions.</p>

          <p>First, if you use Xorg or similar X-based server as your GUI
          server, and this is what nearly all Linux, and most of the other
          non-Windows OSes use, then you don't have any form of GUI-level
          isolation, which is essential for a desktop system.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>She's never heard of Wayland, which is impressive given that this
        was published in 2012 and Wayland was implemented in 2010. It's
        evidence of her obsolescence. We also currently have XLibre, which
        supports Xnamespace; it's an excellent project that aims to make
        X11/Xorg good.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Second, all mainstream desktop OSes, such as Windows, Linux, BSD,
          even OSX, are all based on a monolithic kernels, which present a
          significant security problem.</p>

          <p>This is because a typical monolithic kernel of a contemporary
          desktop OS contains tens of millions of lines of code, and to make it
          worse, most of this code is reachable from (untrusted) applications
          via all sorts of APIs, making the attack surface on the kernel
          huge.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>First, what operating systems is she talking about? I even
        understand her saying this about Linux, given that it is just a kernel
        and that in 2012 Secureblue and many subsequent security
        implementations on/of Linux did not yet exist, but generalizing BSDs as
        if they were all the same is tremendously dishonest or stupid.</p>

        <p>OpenBSD had existed for many, many years and apparently it was
        either unaware of its existence or had never tried to study it to find
        out the approaches adopted by the system to mitigate or end these
        problems. Furthermore, operating systems such as MacOS and other BSDs
        have already greatly improved their security through kernel-level
        isolation, patches and randomization, it does not specify specific
        vulnerabilities and brings everything together as if it were one thing,
        she does not even have knowledge about exploit mitigations.</p>

        <p>To say that monolithic = insecure is intellectual dishonesty. It's
        necessary to first evaluate the monolithic kernel in question;
        furthermore, macOS and Windows use hybrid kernels, which, in design,
        should be more secure than monolithic kernels, but this is not
        absolutely true, and some monolithic kernels have already demonstrated
        superior security, such as OpenBSD's own. The only thing that goes
        through her head besides wind is "virtualization virtualization
        virtualization." This is a tremendous mental limitation.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>In Qubes, on the other hand, we use Xen hypervisor to provide
          security isolation between domains, and Xen is just a few hundred of
          thousands lines of code.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Isolation yes, security no. And these "few" lines of code are
        already much larger than the entire TempleOS. Furthermore, the attack
        surface of Qubes OS is not just Xen, but everything (devices,
        management tools, hypercalls etc.), since not even the /boot partition
        can be encrypted in this crap system, and what do you do to mitigate
        this? Nothing, they rely on unreliable proprietary firmware like Intel
        ME and TPM that only increase the attack surface.</p>

        <p>In fact, everything related to hardware can increase the attack
        surface of QubesOS, as it is the OS that most requires specific
        hardware firmware and vendor patches to be minimally secure and
        stable.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>It also doesn't need to provide all sorts of APIs to applications,
          because the Xen hypervisor is essentially only interested in CPU
          scheduling, memory management and power management, and very few
          things beyond that.</p>

          <p>Most notably, the Xen hypervisor knows nothing about networking,
          disk storage, filesystems, USB stacks, etc, as all those tasks are
          delegated to (often untrusted) service VMs.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Delegating drivers to VMs creates IPC/hypercall/grant surfaces that
        need checking; many XSAs exploit precisely these interactions. You're
        living in another reality if you think this reduces the attack surface,
        it just creates more. Delegating stacks (network, USB, disk) to
        separate domains reduces the impact of bugs on those stacks, but
        creates new interfaces and privileges (backends, control domains, grant
        mappings, hypercalls, emulation) that the hypervisor must mediate and
        validate. In other words, more complexity, more attack surface. Not to
        mention Pass‑through.</p>

        <p>Practical security depends on the threat model (thing that QubesOS
        is horrible), updates (thing that QubesOS is horrible), total attack
        surface (hardware + firmware + software) and not just whether it is
        monolithic or not. The Qubes architecture reduces a certain type of
        risk (compartmentalization), but it does not eliminate risk and
        introduces other surfaces that have already been explored in Xen. Lines
        of code are no substitute for attack surface analysis; therefore
        monolithic &ne; inherently insecure, nor Xen &ne; inherently secure.
        The fact is that the vast majority of vulnerabilities found in Xen are
        serious, which in number already far surpass KVM, by the way.</p>

        <p>While in comparison a minority of vulnerabilities found in operating
        systems such as OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD are severe (&gt;7.0). This
        says a lot, it says that exploiting Xen will almost certainly lead to
        something much more dangerous than exploiting operating systems with a
        strong foundation in security. And it's obviously due to the fact that
        Xen runs at ring 0 (logical ring -1, it has more privileges than a
        kernel) and doesn't have half the mitigations and isolations that an
        full operating system can provide. Vulnerabilities in hypervisors tend
        to have a more critical impact.</p>

        <p>And even with all this, it is still necessary to have the correct
        hardware so as not to end up running into more problems and increasing
        the attack surface even further. It is necessary to have support for
        IOMMU (for adequate insulation), HVM (to avoid PV, which leads to more
        insecurity, but Qubes only supports full HVM for Windows template), and
        preferably not even use AMD, as officially only Intel is truly
        recommended.</p>

        <p>After that she criticizes type 2 hypervisors and insecure virtual
        machines, almost completely valid, with the only mistake being that
        Qubes OS is a magical exception, so I'll skip that.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Qubes itself is much more than just the hypervisor.</p>

        <p>Where the fuck did she get that? Qubes OS is not secure at all

        hypervisor makes things worse.</p>

        <p>"everything that is needed to build a reasonably secure desktop OS"
        And she herself says that she doesn't believe in security mitigations,
        corrections and secure programming, this is absolutely contradictory.
        How can Qubes OS be secure if it goes against everything that
        guarantees the basis of security in the software world?</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>We think Xen is unique because it combines an elegant architecture
          (type I, baremetal, hypervisor) with a number of practical features,

          support for both para-virtualizaed, and fully-virtualized VMs</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>She is redundant when saying "Type 1, baremetal, hypervisor", if it
        is a type 1 hypervisor then it is baremetal, if it is a baremetal
        hypervisor then it is type 1, it makes no sense for her to mention this
        as if it were something exclusive to Xen. She and the Qubes OS devs
        seem to live in a separate reality, I think they even isolated
        themselves from reality through Xen somehow. KVM, Hyper-V and VMM
        (OpenBSD) are other examples of type 1 hypervisors that are more secure
        than Xen.</p>

        <p>Paravirtualization is much less secure than full virtualization as I
        already said in the first topic of the article, this is literally a
        negative point of Xen, and QubesOS only supports full virtualization
        (through HVM) for Windows tamplates, everything else is
        paravirtualization.</p>

          a monolithic kernel</p>

        <p>dom0 and sys-net use which operating system? I'm really starting to
        believe that she isolated herself from reality by somehow entering
        Xen.</p>

        <p>And ChromeOS is incomparably more secure than QubesOS. The system
        and kernel files are located on an immutable partition that cannot be
        changed by apps or malware. It is sandboxing by design, each browser
        tab, app and service runs isolated with least privileges. It features
        atomic updates, native user data encryption, and Android/Linux
        containers. ChromeOS is arguably one of the most secure operating
        systems in the world, but it is absolute trash when it comes to
        privacy, which is why I don't recommend it to anyone. But it is
        certainly safer than QubesFraud.</p>

          <p>Not all virtual machine software is equal when it comes to
          security.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Right, even they admit it, let's see what comes next.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>You may have used or heard of VMs in relation to software like
          VirtualBox or VMware Workstation. These are known as Type 2 or hosted
          hypervisors.</p>

          <p>However, the fact that Type 2 hypervisors run under the host OS
          means that they're really only as secure as the host OS itself. If
          the host OS is ever compromised, then any VMs it hosts are also
          effectively compromised.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Absolutely true. This is true for QubesOS too; if dom0 (or even
        NetVM) is compromised, it's all over. It is intellectual dishonesty on
        the part of the developers to pretend that this statement does not
        apply to Qubes OS.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>By contrast, Qubes uses a Type 1 or bare-metal hypervisor called
          Xen. Instead of running inside an OS, Type 1 hypervisors run directly
          on the bare metal of the hardware.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>That's true, this makes compromising the hypervisor even more
        dangerous, since its output goes directly to the hardware, or even
        below the kernel permission level (logical ring -1).</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>This means that an attacker must be capable of subverting the
          hypervisor itself in order to compromise the entire system, which is
          vastly more difficult.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Absolutely false, this doesn't make things harder for the attacker,
        it makes them easier, since a type 1 hypervisor is the only layer of
        protection you'll have between the hardware and the guest VM, a single
        failure in the hypervisor or in the delegation infrastructure
        compromises everything. In addition to achieving less isolation, since,
        as mentioned, Xen runs directly on the hardware.</p>

        <p>And you developers know the danger of placing all your hopes on a
        hypervisor; after all, you created the border color layout for each VM,
        indicating the trust levels. You dishonest people.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>How does Qubes OS compare to using a separate physical
          machine?</p>

          <p>Using a separate physical computer for sensitive activities can
          certainly be more secure than using one computer with a conventional
          OS for everything</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>True. Therefore, do not use Qubes OS, which aims to centralize
        everything with the vain proposal of compartmentalization.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Physical separation doesn't rely on a hypervisor. (It's very
          unlikely that an attacker will break out of Qubes' hypervisor, but if
          one were to manage to do so, one could potentially gain control over
          the entire system.)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Look how these idiots don't believe in security through correction,
        kernel isolation and randomization, but believe in Xen as their god, a
        tool they didn't even create. They place all their hopes on other
        developers' tools and put them on a pedestal as if they were
        untouchable; that's stupid.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Physical separation can be a natural complement to physical
          security. (For example, you might find it natural to lock your secure
          laptop in a safe when you take your unsecure laptop out with
          you.)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>That's the smartest thing to do, but you literally recommend the
        opposite: using a single device for all your life's activities,
        promising that you'll be protected through compartmentalization.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Physical separation can be cumbersome and expensive, since we may
          have to obtain and set up a separate physical machine for each
          security level we need.</p>

        <p>Exactly the same argument used in the first topic: "I have already
        decided to run the multiple things on one box because I am cheap, and I
        need to invent reasons why I can continue doing so".</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>There's generally no secure way to transfer data between
          physically separate computers running conventional OSes. (Qubes has a

        <p>"No, my love, you don't need to use that. We guarantee your security

        device. Trust your daddy."</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Physically separate computers running conventional OSes are still

        <p>And is Qubes OS unconventional? Using a conventional Fedora/Debian
        template, using the conventional Linux kernel for dom0 and domUs (or
        windows, which is worse), using conventional GNU libraries and
        programs? I know that Qubes OS is unique in that it's a huge piece of
        crap, but that doesn't make it anything other than just another
        GNU/Linux system.</p>

        <p>With hardware-based partitioning, you can use much more secure Linux

        hardware firmware backdoor or exploit) in which QubesOS is also totally

        be some kind of supernatural being; I'd like to see an example of
        malware that could do this, reach air-gapped devices.</p>

        <p>If you're talking about advanced attacks performed on theoretical
        academic research, like: AirHopper/GSMem/USBee - exfiltrate data by
        modulating electromagnetic emissions or signals via cables to nearby
        receivers (cell phone/modem). Fansmitter/BitWhisper/DiskFiltration -
        use varying fan speeds, vibration, or electrical signatures to transmit
        bits to nearby sensors. IREXF/LEDitGo/xLED - use LED indicators,
        displays or infrared lights to optically transmit data to
        cameras/phones. MAGNETO/ODINI - magnetic techniques to exfiltrate data
        through variations in magnetic fields detectable by nearby devices.</p>

        <p>So I'm sorry to inform you, nothing in the world can defeat this
        other than hardware or additional physical protections like Faraday
        Cage. You're all delusional if you think Qubes OS will protect against
        this kind of insanity.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, such attacks are carried out in controlled environments
        and with minimal or zero external interference. Being practically
        impossible to do in real scenarios. An example of this is the attack
        discovered in 2024 in which hackers use the friction sound caused by
        the finger on the cell phone screen to steal fingerprints. <a href=
        "https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-618-paper.pdf">https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-618-paper.pdf</a></p>

        <p>But this research and simulation was done in a precisely controlled
        environment, with precise sound capture and noise isolation equipment,
        and even with all this there is only a 27.9% chance for partial
        fingerprint and 9.3% for full fingerprint, even in the perfect scenario
        the chances are ridiculous. In other words, if the attack is carried
        out against a resident of India it will be useless, since the deafening
        and endless noise of vehicle horns would make it completely
        impossible.</p>

        <p>So you all don't know anything about what you're talking about,
        you're throwing phrases around without even knowing how it works or
        what it means.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>What is the main concept behind Qubes?</p>

          <p>To build security on the Security by Compartmentalization (or
          Isolation) principle.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>"Building security on the principle of hope*, because we cannot
        guarantee that our compartmentalization will work. And we don't have
        other layers of protection because we don't believe in security through
        correction and randomization which is already common sense and used by
        everyone in the world of technology."</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>What about safe languages and formally verified microkernels?</p>

          <p>In short: these are non-realistic solutions today. We discuss this
          in further depth in our Architecture Specification document.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Wow, impressive. But wasn't Xen written in C/Assembly? And it's not
        formally verified either&hellip; So I hate to break it to you, but
        Qubes OS is completely vulnerable to memory management exploits. But
        it's a shame you don't believe that.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Why does Qubes use virtualization?</p>

          <p>We believe that this is currently the only practically viable
          approach to implementing strong isolation while simultaneously
          providing compatibility with existing applications and drivers.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>"We believe", "We believe", "We believe"&hellip; You know, it seems
        to me that you're all lunatics who deny reality and live only in your
        imaginary worlds of belief. And what about the "compatibility" thing?
        This damn system isn't even compatible with the hardware, get out of
        here!</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The unfortunate reality right now is that an operating system
          cannot be secure without a certain minimum number of proprietary
          closed-source blobs (e.g., CPU microcode updates). A 100% free
          operating system that excludes all such blobs is vulnerable to known
          exploits and is therefore unsuitable for any use case where security
          matters.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>That's 100% false. Since when can only blobs vendors create secure
        and reliable code? On the contrary, how can code be secure and reliable
        without an audit proving it? This only allows many bugs and
        vulnerabilities (or even backdoors, since it's impossible to prove they
        don't exist) to remain hidden for a long time without being fixed.</p>

        <p>OpenBSD is one of the most secure, if not the most secure, operating
        systems in the world, and is an example of an OS without proprietary
        blobs by default. But of course, it doesn't rely on processor
        virtualization technology to be secure, LOL.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>A core tenet of the Qubes philosophy is distrust the
          infrastructure, where the infrastructure refers to things like
          hosting providers, CDNs, DNS services, package repositories, email
          servers, PGP keyservers, etc.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>But you all trust Tor, don't you? Ultimately, they are your only
        recommendation for anonymity.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>As a project, we focus on securing endpoints instead of attempting
          to secure the middle (i.e., the infrastructure)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>How the hell can you be secure at the endpoint if you have to go
        through the insecure midpoint first? What kind of nonsense is that?</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>since one of our primary goals is to free users from being forced
          to entrust their security to unknown third parties.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Like Xen and Whonix&hellip; cough&hellip; cough.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Instead, our aim is for users to be required to trust as few
          entities as possible (ideally, only themselves and any known persons
          whom they voluntarily decide to trust).</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And Xen, right?</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>We believe that many attempts to make the infrastructure appear
          trustworthy actually provide only the illusion of security and are
          ultimately a disservice to real users.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>So, with this, you're admitting that your infrastructure isn't
        secure? Furthermore, you're literally sinking your users into a
        illusion of security through a single third-party tool. Is there a
        greater disservice than that?</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Although we caution users against placing undue trust in this
          website because we distrust the infrastructure, we have no objection
          to enabling website security features when doing so is relatively
          costless and provides some marginal benefit to website visitors.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Each qube has read-only access to the template on which it's
          based, so if a qube is compromised, it cannot infect its template or
          any of the other qubes based on that template.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The statement is not true. AppVMs have read-only access to the
        TemplateVM filesystem, so they cannot directly modify the template
        files while it is offline. However, if the template is started (for
        example, to install/update software) while compromised by network
        access or a malicious binary, the template can become infected; this
        then spreads to AppVMs that use that template.</p>

        <p>RPC services (qrexec), shared folders, or copy/update mechanisms
        (e.g., updating packages in the template) can be abused by an attacker
        in an AppVM to perform actions that affect the template or influence
        qubes that receive data from it. And obviously, exploits in the
        hypervisor, dom0, or other attack surfaces of QubesOS can allow
        privilege escalation to alter templates or other qubes.</p>

        <p>Finally, a cloned template does not automatically receive patches
        from the original template; if an attacker compromises the "source"
        template before cloning, clones will remain compromised. And they
        themselves say:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Updates are naturally centralized, since updating a template means
          that all qubes based on it will automatically use those updates after
          they're restarted.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>And you know what? What guarantees that the developers themselves
        cannot be compromised by large organizations and provide operating
        system images or even template updates that have already been
        maliciously compromised? OpenBSD and other operating systems can
        protect themselves against this in various ways, but what about Qubes
        OS?</p>

        <p>I considered continuing and refuting the entire Architecture
        Specification document, but that would only take up readers' time on
        many topics already discussed. However, I do intend to refute this
        entire PDF point by point, as it is the basis of the Qubes OS
        architecture, and it was written with terrible arguments by someone who
        understands almost nothing about security and software architecture,

        <h2>16 - Terrible against zero-day attacks</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>A zero-day (also known as a 0-day) is a vulnerability or security
          hole in a computer system unknown to its developers or anyone capable
          of mitigating it. Until the vulnerability is remedied, threat actors
          can exploit it in a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_vulnerability">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_vulnerability</a>
        </p>

        <p>Qubes OS offers good damage control for failures in guest VMs, but
        its large virtualization-based TCB (Trusted Computing Base) makes it
        structurally more vulnerable to zero-days attacking privileged
        components than alternatives with smaller TCB, focus on correctness,
        and aggressive mitigators (GrapheneOS, OpenBSD, hardening/enterprise
        Linux distros). Here I will return to some points already discussed
        previously, but with the sole ultimate objective of proving something
        else.</p>

        <p>Qubes relies on compartmentalization via virtualization (Xen, dom0,
        VMs with separate privileges) as the main layer of defense, which can
        be good for reducing the individual impact of known vulnerabilities
        when the focus of attack is guest VMs and limiting blast radius. But
        defense against zero‑days depends on the probability of occurrence and
        the ease with which a failure can escape the box in which it is
        located; at this point Qubes loses completely.</p>

        <p>First, the hypervisor and the set of I/O drivers (firmware,
        controllers, devices) remain large privileged code written mostly in
        C/assembly, without formal verification; A zero-day that allows code
        execution on the hypervisor or DMA (Direct Memory Access) support can
        escape from a VM to dom0 or the hypervisor itself, compromising all
        compartments at once. And this is extremely easy, as the complexity of
        the entire Qubes OS together leads to a greater likelihood of bugs and
        certainly leads to a larger attack surface, especially when it comes to
        memory management.</p>

        <p>Second, the aggregate attack surface of Qubes is high. In addition
        to the hypervisor, there is the kernel(s) of multiple exposed hardware
        templates and drivers, IPC, hypercalls, grant, backends, control
        domains, grant mappings, emulation, firmware (TPM, Intel ME),
        PCIe/Thunderbolt, unprotected /boot partition and more - more code
        means more statistical probability of exploitable unknown bugs. Each
        component is an additional source of zero days; Qubes' "many moving
        parts" architecture increases the total surface area compared to
        systems with deliberately smaller TCBs.</p>

        <p>Third, modern mitigaters (ASLR, KARL, KPTI, retpoline, SELinux,
        namespaces, etc.) reduce or obfuscate the kernel's attack surface
        through isolation or randomization. Taking into account that QubesOS
        developers do not believe in security through randomization, kernel
        mitigations and code correction, this system has nothing that reduces
        or obfuscates its attack surface, as it does not even have VM spoofing,
        being completely visible to an attacker.</p>

        <p>Fourth, alternatives like GrapheneOS (designed for a hostile
        environment at the user and mobile kernel level) or OpenBSD (emphasis
        on code auditing and mitigation by default) reduce the chance of many
        zero-days occurring and exploited by having smaller stacks, more
        aggressive hardening policies, and less dependence on proprietary
        drivers; Linux implementations like Secureblue aim to protect not only
        against known but also unknown vulnerabilities (the same goes for the
        other 2 OSes mentioned above), reducing the attack surface, making
        elevation of privilege exploits much more difficult in principle.</p>

        <p>Fifth, Qubes OS is betting that zero-day vulnerabilities will be
        rare or non-existent, whether in Xen or in all other components/attack
        surfaces, but the reality is that all new software and hardware
        vulnerabilities are zero-day; every week, every month dozens or
        hundreds of zero-day vulnerabilities emerge that require fast and
        predictable patches, something that the QubesOS devs do not believe or
        cannot do (e.g., Xen is developed and maintained by other developers).
        So enterprise operating systems like RHEL, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux,
        Ubuntu, FreeBSD; or operating systems focused on bug and vulnerability
        correctness like OpenBSD are the best at fixing new vulnerabilities,
        known as zero-days, extremely reducing the likelihood of you being
        affected by it.</p>

        <p>Finally, the Qubes security model assumes that compartmentalization
        will be the only and primary security; that's practical, but it's a
        horrible bet against a world that doesn't act as its developers think.
        When an effective zero-day arises against the hypervisor, or against
        privileged subsystems, compartmentalization does not fix or randomize
        the bug - it simply depends on the bug never existing or not being
        scalable. In comparison, systems with lower privileged TCB, audited
        code/smaller attack surface, and mitigations offer greater structural
        resistance to zero-day attacks.</p>

        <p>"QubesOS allows you to use OpenBSD and all these other operating
        systems inside qubes", you might say, and no, it doesn't. The only
        officially supported templates are Fedora and Debian, there are
        templates for other OSes maintained by the community, but they are not
        even actively updated or tested by Qubes OS devs, which further
        diminishes trust.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>In all cases, the Qubes OS Project does not provide updates for
          these templates.</p>

          <p>In addition, these templates may be somewhat less stable, since
          the Qubes developers do not test them.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><a href=
        "https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/templates.html">https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/user/templates/templates.html</a>
        </p>

        <p>QubesOS is not even stable by default and yet they offer even more
        unstable ways to use it? How would this increase security (especially
        against zero-days)? You can't take this operating system seriously, not
        if you're like me and value security first.</p>

        <p>But even if it were possible this would further increase the surface
        attack (hypervisor + guest), the ideal defense is generally to reduce
        the TCB, not stack it and further increase the complexity and the
        propensity for bugs, that's not how security works. You can't
        accumulate more and more code and think that this will give you
        security, it's totally the opposite. And also Qubes templates are
        limited, they run modified versions of OSes and are paravirtualized,
        all of this is harmful when it comes to security. And again, what
        isolates the hypervisor from the guest operating system? Absolutely
        nothing.</p>

        <h1>THE END</h1>

        <p>QubesOS is not the best and not even a good alternative for those
        seeking security, nor anonymity because without security you can't
        maintain anonymity for a long time. This OS is for those who seek for a
        quick and easy control/dispatch of virtual machines, whether for
        testing or common use; and for those who in exchange for security want
        to be able to have and separate many profiles, whether for privacy or
        for work, or for both.</p>

        <p>Some of the topics and complaints in this article may apply to other
        Linux distributions and other operating systems, but only QubesOS fits
        all of them at the same time; it's unique in being such garbage. There
        are far superior alternatives when it comes to security and isolation,
        which i will talk about later.</p>

        <p>For anonymity only, Tails is superior; but Whonix is stronger for
        security. You can use Whonix in any Linux system, systems that may even
        be safer than QubesOS and through the KVM that is a more secure
        virtualizer than Xen, as previously stated.</p>

        <p>Qubes OS's compartmentalization approach achieves useful
        risk‑reduction for desktop threat models, but its security guarantees
        are limited by architectural choices. A large privileged hypervisor
        (Xen) and dom0 form a concentrated TCB (Trusted Computing Base) with
        ongoing XSAs (Xen Security Advisory), paravirtualized interfaces make
        VMs easily fingerprintable and increase guest -&gt; hypervisor
        channels. The system inherits Linux (Fedora/Debian) kernel and driver
        surface and Qubes depends on modern CPU microcode and a small set of
        certified hardware. Disposable qubes mitigate persistence but do not
        remove the core high‑privilege attack surface. For high‑assurance
        server, high threat model or enterprise use where a minimized,
        auditable TCB, formal hardening, long support windows, and headless
        management are required - Qubes' desktop‑centric design is a misfit
        rather than a solution.</p>

        <p>An operating system designed by people who don't believe in security
        through clean code, bug fixes and mitigations cannot be trusted,
        because its developer base is not trustworthy.</p>

        <p>If your threat model doesn't involve serious and persistent
        adversaries, powerful organizations, or state actors, Qubes OS might be
        good for you. If you prioritize compartmentalization over stability and
        want to manage multiple aspects of your life simultaneously without
        worrying about servers, zero-day vulnerabilities, or hardware
        compatibility issues, then Qubes OS might be perfect for you. If your
        enemy consists of amateur hackers and common criminals, Qubes OS might
        be sufficient for you. It is appropriate against less capable
        adversaries, such as script kiddies and opportunistic criminals.</p>

        <p><strong>Reality check</strong>: Qubes suits solo enthusiasts trading
        manageability, stability, compatibility, predictability and security
        for experimental compartmentalization.</p>

        <h2>Points to consider:</h2>

        <p>I know that VMs bring compartmentalization at the OS level, it
        brings great ease in many aspects. But the sandbox at the user level is
        more safe in addition to being much less complex. An escape from this
        sandboxing limit an attacker to the user's context; an escape typically
        only grants user privileges, not hardware control. While a breach or
        control of the Hypervisor takes the attacker to the hardware.</p>

        <p>There is no such thing as perfect security, much less perfect
        isolation, but there is security greater than QubesOS.</p>

        <p>I personally don't have much faith in virtual machines when it comes
        to security, and I think you shouldn't either. But in my opinion, the
        most reliable hypervisor is OpenBSD's, called VMM.</p>

        <p><a href=
        "https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq16.html">https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq16.html</a>
        </p>

        <p>That after much reluctance, even from the creator of OpenBSD,
        arrived at the system, but created from scratch to be safe, focused on
        absolute security, unlike all other existing hypervisors. And that's
        why it won't have some features like:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Graphics</li>

          <li>Snapshots</li>

          <li>Guest SMP support</li>

          <li>Hardware passthrough</li>

          <li>Live migration across hosts</li>

          <li>Live hardware change</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Other than that, use KVM or even Hyper-V, it will serve you well and
        historically it's safer than Xen.</p>

        <p>Other criticisms of QubesOS made by other people that you might want
        to see, but that doesn't mean I agree 100% with them (and may
        contradict what was said in this article):</p>

        <h2>My recommendations instead of QubesOS</h2>

        <h3>1 - OpenBSD</h3>

        <p>Simply the most secure operating system by default in the world.
        Designed from the beginning in 1995 for first-place security, it is an
        operating system with the ultimate goal of being the safest in the
        world. It was a NetBSD fork that until then is already an secure OS,
        but that did not please the paranoid and wise <strong>Theo de Raadt
        (the creator)</strong>. It is first focused on being safe in the code
        and then implementing mitigations. The main focus is on fixing bugs
        before fixing vulnerabilities, because every vulnerability is a bug,
        but not every bug is a vulnerability. <a href=

        <p>For a better understanding of why OpenBSD is so secure compared to
        other operating systems, read my other article: <a href=
        "./openbsd-solos.html"></a>Why OpenBSD solos?</p>

        <p>OpenBSD is perfect for servers, after all it was created for that,
        but it's also excellent for desktops (I use it myself for daily
        driving, and I'm writing this article on it).</p>

        <h3>2 - FreeBSD</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"FreeBSD is an operating system for a variety of platforms which
          focuses on features, speed, and stability. Offers advanced
          networking, performance, security and compatibility features today
          which are still missing in other operating systems, even some of the
          best commercial ones."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">https://www.freebsd.org</a>
        </p>

        <p>FreeBSD has "jails," something no other operating system in the
        world has, and this provides a high level of isolation (through
        sandboxing), although it is not configured by default. Jails virtualize
        the access to the file system, the set of users, and the networking
        subsystem. This allows you to isolate the base system, services,
        network and Linux binaries in a very secure way, without depending on a
        hypervisor. You can achieve much more compartmentalization than with
        QubesOS and in a much simpler way, without spending many resources.

        </ul>

        <p>FreeBSD is an amazing operating system for everything. Servers,
        desktops, routers, and even gaming-it's actually the best BSD for
        gaming. You can play Steam games, although with less compatibility than
        on Linux, but through Wine you can achieve the same game compatibility
        as Linux. FreeBSD also has compatibility with Linux binaries through
        Linuxlator, unlike OpenBSD.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>For proper installation and post-configuration, READ THE

        </ul>

        <p>FreeBSD is not secure by default. Knowledge about it security tools
        (firewalls, jails, capsium, etc.) is necessary.</p>

        <h3>3 - Gentoo Hardened</h3>

        <p>This will take several days and maintenance is difficult, but it's
        the only way to have the highest possible security in a Linux operating
        system. In addition, it offers absolute minimalism and superior
        performance to any other existing operating system. Minimalist systems
        are always the best when it comes to low attack surface, and nothing in
        the Linux world does this better than Gentoo.</p>

        <p>Gentoo can be considered the perfect Linux operating system, but
        only if you perform a proper installation and configuration. Please,
        read the fucking manual.</p>

        <h3>4 - Fedora Secureblue</h3>

        <p>Hardened Fedora Silverblue which is an immutable Fedora.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Secureblue is a security-focused desktop and server Linux
          operating system. It is shipped as a set of OCI bootable container
          images, which are generated with BlueBuild, using Fedora Atomic
          Desktop's base images as a starting point.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>It has several incredible kernel security patches in addition to
        SELinux enforcing policies. It uses GrapheneOS's hardened_malloc (most
        secure malloc) globally and implements security mitigations inspired by
        OpenBSD. This is the most secure Linux system by default. <a href=
        "https://secureblue.dev/">https://secureblue.dev</a></p>

        <p>Its only drawback is its use of SystemD, but this is undoubtedly
        outweighed by Secureblue impressive features. <a href=

        <h3>5 - NetBSD</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"NetBSD is a free, fast, secure, and highly portable Unix-like
          Open Source operating system. It is available for a wide range of
          platforms, from large-scale servers and powerful desktop systems to
          handheld and embedded devices."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>is the best operating system for embedded/IoT devices, boasting
        compatibility with an extraordinary variety of architectures and
        hardware. However, it's not very user-friendly for desktop use.
        <a href="https://www.netbsd.org/">https://www.netbsd.org</a></p>

        <p>NetBSD can also be extremely minimalist for those who know how to
        configure it, more so than any other BSD.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Several security features are available in NetBSD, including
          IPsec, a homegrown firewall (NPF), a file integrity system
          (Veriexec), a kernel authorization framework (kauth(9)), disk
          encryption (CGD), among others. In terms of exploit mitigations,
          NetBSD supports a good number of modern features: W^X (in both
          userland and the kernel), Userland ASLR, Kernel ASLR, SMEP, SMAP, and
          a variety of other internal kernel bug detection features.</p>

        programs (although different from FreeBSD).</p>

        <h3>6 - Alpine Linux</h3>

        <blockquote>
          Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution
          based on musl libc and busybox. Was designed with security in mind.
          All userland binaries are compiled as Position Independent
          Executables (PIE) with stack smashing protection. These proactive
          security features prevent exploitation of entire classes of zero-day
          and other vulnerabilities.
        </blockquote>

        <p><a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">https://alpinelinux.org/</a>
        </p>

        <p>It uses musl, BusyBox, and OpenRC instead of the more commonly used
        glibc, GNU Core Utilities, and systemd. This makes Alpine one of few
        Linux distributions not to be based on the GNU Core Utilities or glibc,
        which greatly reduced the attack surface. Sometimes I think of Alpine
        as "Linux if it were good". It is an excellent OS for Docker, widely
        used by the way.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Alpine have hardened_malloc (GrapheneOS malloc) native support,

        <h3>7 - Artix Linux Hardened</h3>

        <p>Artix is Arch Linux but good (doesn't have SystemD).</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Artix uses real init systems, because PID1 must be simple, secure
          and stable.</p>

          GNU/Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable
          versions of most software by following a rolling release model. The
          default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user
          to only add what is purposely required. Arch Linux defines simplicity
          as without unnecessary additions or modifications.</p>

        <p>With more than 15,000 packages available in the official
        repositories and with more than 95,000 available in the AUR (Arch User
        Repository), you will have access to all types of software in its most
        recent updates, Arch really stands out in this aspect. Not to mention
        other unofficial repositories, such as Chaotic-AUR, BlackArch and even
        EndeavourOS and Manjaro (2 Arch based distros). There's even a Chinese
        community repository with a bunch of amazing software. After Gentoo,
        this is the most minimalist (which, as mentioned earlier, reduces the
        attack surface) and fastest way to use Linux possible.</p>

        <p>Just be careful when downloading packages from unofficial
        repositories (such as the AUR), because as they are maintained by the
        community, there may be malicious software, as has happened a few
        times. Always check who the maintainer is, the creation/update date,
        the origin of the build and the GPG signature of the repository and
        keyring.</p>

        <h3>8 - TrueNAS</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>TrueNAS is a high performance data platform for managing any type
          of data, delivered through turnkey self-healing storage appliances
          and expert around-the-clock support.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><a href="https://www.truenas.com/">https://www.truenas.com/</a>
        </p>

        <p>Built around the OpenZFS file system, TrueNAS provides a number of
        built-in file and block storage services as well as an OS-level
        virtualized app store (Linux containers and FreeBSD jails respectively)
        and virtual machine hypervisor to host additional services. It receives
        constant and solid security updates, in addition to a good audit by the
        developers.</p>

        <p>The products consist of TrueNAS Enterprise and TrueNAS Community
        Edition. TrueNAS Enterprise is a family of storage appliances, with
        fully integrated software and hardware, that is sold as a commercial
        product with enterprise support. TrueNAS Community Edition can be
        installed for free on commodity x86-64 computers.</p>

        <p>If your goal is to manage long-term data in a secure, stable and
        reliable way, TrueNAS Community Edition (or Enterprise, you choose) is
        one of the best alternatives. As it is based on FreeBSD, it inherits
        many of its advantages, as well as having full Linux support. It's an
        excellent operating system for servers or for long-term offline
        storage. Nothing better than OpenZFS for this, the best file-system of
        all in my opinion, it has an insane data compression and native
        encryption. ZFS compression is capable of compressing files by 2x or
        more, meaning that if you have 500GB of disk storage, you will be able
        to store up to ~1TB of data. (OpenZFS is available natively for
        FreeBSD, also available for NetBSD and others. It is also available for
        Linux, although in an experimental and unstable with many
        incompatibilities).</p>

        <h3>9 - Kicksecure</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Kicksecure is a free and open-source Linux distribution that aims
          to provide a highly secure computing environment. It has been
          developed from the ground up according to a formidable &ndash; and
          time proven &ndash; defense in-depth security design. In the default
          configuration, Kicksecure provides superior layered defenses of
          protection from many types of Malware.</p>

          <p>Kicksecure is a complete computer operating system. Numerous
          applications come pre-installed with safe defaults which can be used
          immediately upon installation with minimal user input.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This distribution is an extensively reconfigured version of the
        Debian base, in terms of security, and is the base system for Whonix.
        For users familiar with the ease of use of Debian, this may be the best
        option. After Secureblue (and probably Alpine), this is the most secure
        Linux distribution by default. <a href=
        "https://www.kicksecure.com/">https://www.kicksecure.com</a></p>

        <h3>10 - RHEL, Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux respectively</h3>

        <p>These are the best Linux operating systems for businesses that want
        robust enterprise security, fast and tested updates and patches, binary
        compatibility with the RHEL ecosystem, long lifecycles to reduce churn,
        commercial support (or third-party support options), standards
        compliance (SELinux, Secure Boot, FIPS/benchmarks via partners), low
        attack surface (in the Linux way) and operational predictability-while
        keeping total cost of ownership controlled and providing a stable
        experience suitable for both advanced users and home
        administrators.</p>

        <p>However, I have to give my opinion about Red Hat. I don't like this
        IBM-slave organization at all; it poisons the Linux world, and I
        believe its main objective is to centralize the Linux ecosystem in its
        hands. But it's undeniable that its systems and software are excellent
        and difficult to match in the business world.</p>

            <p><strong>HardenedBSD</strong> is a FreeBSD fork focused on
            absolute security, with dozens of implementations and technologies
            that FreeBSD or even OpenBSD does not have. This can be the most
            secure OS of all times but i do not understand much about it and
            the development of this OS seems a mess, with few devs (or only
            one?). Better than Linux anyway. (If any user or developer wants to
            explain more about this OS I would love it, but even the official

            secure than QubesOS (and every linux distro) but is for phones.
            <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">https://grapheneos.org</a> It is
            possible to completely separate profiles, with each profile
            containing its own libraries and programs in the system, and it is
            even possible to create completely offline profiles with data
            isolation. A safer, simpler and less complex form of isolation than
            Qubes OS.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><strong>NixOS</strong> has everything to be a very secure Linux
            system, if it weren't for that damned SystemD. All the system's
            default configuration and behavior remains in one file, making the
            system reproducible, declarative and stable. It also has an

            <p>But it's still under development? I don't even know how to
            install it. But in that case, NixOS would probably be above
            hardened Artix.</p>

            <p><strong>SculpOS/GenodeOS</strong> have a very, insane strong
            security. It has a micro-kernel formally verified focused on
            extreme security called Sel4. But it is not a system for general
            use, you cannot do much in it. Have so much potential. <a href=

          <li>
            <p><strong>RedoxOS</strong> is a complete Unix-like
            microkernel-based operating system written from scratch in Rust,
            with a focus on security, reliability and safety. Have so much
            potential but you can't do much on it too besides playing balatro.

          <li>
            <p><strong>Linux from Scratch (LFS)</strong>: Stay away from this,
            it's extremely complex and unrewarding. You can't achieve much more
            security than Gentoo, and even its official guide uses SystemD as a
            base (It's possible to do it without them, but only experimentally
            and without many guides.). Maintenance would be very difficult and
            extremely risky; it's literally creating your own Linux distro.
            Unless you're a crazy wizard and have months of free time along
            with advanced knowledge of Linux systems, please don't try it. But
            it's undeniable that this is the most minimalist way to use Linux,
            or are there other ways? Perhaps "Linux from nothing". I've done it
            before, so I can confidently say it's not worth it, even though
            it's a lot of fun hehehe.</p>

          <li>
            <p><strong>Openwall GNU/*/Linux</strong>: It could be interesting,
            more research and understanding is needed. <a href=

        </ul>

        <p><strong>For Linux systems that support it, I also recommend
        installing LKRG (Linux Kernel Runtime Guard) and
        hardened_malloc:</strong>

          <p>An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity. For an
          idiot, anything more complicated is the more he will admire it, if
          you make something so cluster fucked he can't understand it, he's
          gonna think you're a god. Cause you made it so complicated nobody can
          understand it.</p>
